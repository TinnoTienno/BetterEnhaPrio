### BETTER ENHA PRIO (3.3.5a) ###

# Goal : 
To provide an extensive priority management on the enhancement shaman.

#What is already there : 
- simple icon list interface
- right click to switch between AOE and Single-Target modes
- variety of options settings
- good priority management for StormStrike, LavaLash, FireShock, EarthShock, Lightning Shield

#What still needs to be done : 
- Better AOE-Single target Modes with the addition of Chain lightning in the interface - WIP
    - Adding a switch between modes using Lightning Bold and Chain Lightning to track what mode we're using
- good priority management for Magma Totem, Fire Elemental Totem, Feral Spirits, Racial CD, Profession CDs, Trinket CDs
- precisely track both hands swings
- Add Lightning Bolt weaving mechanics -> add Lightning bolts to priority if it fits between auto-attacks
- A predictive management using GCD to anticipate on the next priority
